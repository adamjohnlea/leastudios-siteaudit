/**
 * Holds a map of `id => factory` and resolves each factory at most once,
 * caching the result. Factories receive the container itself as their only
 * argument so they can pull dependencies via {@see Container::get()}.
 *
 * Why not autowiring: this codebase wires ~25 services in a fixed shape,
 * and the constructor argument lists are stable. Explicit factory closures
 * give us clear, greppable wiring without reflection magic and without a
 * vendored library — a deliberate fit for the per-plugin self-contained
 * deployment model.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```php
 * $c = new Container();
 * $c->set( 'logger', static fn() => new Logger() );
 * $c->set( 'service', static fn( Container $c ) => new Service( $c->get( 'logger' ) ) );
 * $service = $c->get( 'service' );
 * ```
 *
 * Resolution is lazy and idempotent: a service is built the first time
 * `get()` is called for it, and every subsequent `get()` returns the same
 * instance. There is no scope/lifetime concept — every service is a
 * singleton within the container's lifetime (which matches the plugin's
 * request lifetime).
